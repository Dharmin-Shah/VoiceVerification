# Voice Recognition Project using Machine Learning and PyAudioAnalysis

This is a simple project that uses machine learning and PyAudioAnalysis repo to recognize the speaker.

Using the PyAudioAnalysis' repo we extract features of audio file (wav file format) and then save them in pickle files.

As an additional element, I have used SQLite to persist the models.

The dataset used for this project is Kaggle's <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/vjcalling/speaker-recognition-audio-dataset'> Speaker Recognition Audio Dataset </a>
  
For access to the dataset please download the kaggle.json file. <a href='https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api#api-credentials'> Read Here </a>
